This is a solution to the [Crowdfunding product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/)
- [Micromodal](https://micromodal.vercel.app/)

### What I learned

First time i struggle with modal. Challanging but fun.

### Useful resources

- [Element.closest()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest) - I found particularly useful this function that allows to target the closest parent with a given class, id or attribute.
- [Client-side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - The MDN page on form validation is always useful.
